## What it is

BookLib packages expert knowledge from canonical programming books into skills that AI agents can apply directly to your code. It ships with 22 curated, evaluated skills — and a discovery engine that can find, index, and inject hundreds more from the community.

**Two layers:**

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Bundled library** | 22 skills from canonical books, pre-indexed, ready to use out of the box |
| **Discovery ecosystem** | Finds and fetches skills from GitHub repos, community registries, and npm packages |

BookLib is not a static install. It's a local knowledge engine: semantic search over skill content, automatic context injection via hooks, role-based profiles for swarm agents, and a sync bridge that makes every fetched skill available to any Claude Code-compatible orchestrator.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm install -g @booklib/skills

# Build the local search index
booklib index

# Search for wisdom by concept
booklib search "how to handle null values in Kotlin"

# Discover and install all trusted skills (bundled + community)
booklib setup

# Sync all fetched skills → available to Claude Code's Skill tool and orchestrators
booklib sync
```

## Discovery

BookLib can find and index skills beyond the bundled set. Configure sources in `booklib.config.json`:

```json
{
  "sources": [
    { "type": "registry", "trusted": true },
    { "type": "manifest", "url": "./community/registry.json", "trusted": true },
    { "type": "github-skills-dir", "repo": "obra/superpowers", "dir": "skills", "branch": "main", "trusted": true },
    { "type": "github-skills-dir", "repo": "ruvnet/ruflo", "dir": ".claude/skills", "branch": "main", "trusted": true },
    { "type": "github-org", "org": "your-org" },
    { "type": "npm-scope", "scope": "@your-scope" }
  ]
}
```

```bash
booklib discover              # list available skills from all sources
booklib discover --refresh    # force re-scan (bypass 24h cache)
booklib fetch naming-cheatsheet    # download and index a specific skill
booklib setup                 # fetch all trusted skills at once
```

Source types: `registry` (bundled), `manifest` (JSON list at URL or local path), `github-skills-dir` (any repo with a `skills/` subdirectory), `github-org`, `npm-scope`.

> Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to raise the GitHub API limit from 60 to 5000 req/hr:
> `GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) booklib discover --refresh`

---

## Orchestrator Compatibility

After `booklib sync`, every fetched skill lives at `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — the path Claude Code's native Skill tool reads from. No extra configuration needed.

```bash
booklib sync    # write all fetched skills to ~/.claude/skills/
```

| Orchestrator | Install | Skills surface via |
|---|---|---|
| [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | `/plugin install superpowers` | Skill tool — available in every session |
| [ruflo](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo) | `npm install -g ruflo` | Skill tool — available in every session |

BookLib uses a `.booklib` marker file to track directories it manages and never overwrites skills you placed there manually.

---

## Swarm & Role-Based Profiles

Equip agents in a swarm with the right skills for their role:

```bash
booklib profile reviewer     # skills for a code reviewer agent
booklib profile security     # skills for a security auditor
booklib profile architect    # skills for a system design agent
```

Roles: `architect` · `coder` · `reviewer` · `tester` · `security` · `frontend` · `optimizer` · `devops` · `ai-engineer` · `manager`

Get a full skill map for a swarm trigger pipeline:

```bash
booklib swarm-config audit      # security → tester agent roles + their skills
booklib swarm-config feature    # architect → coder → reviewer → tester
booklib swarm-config            # list all configured triggers
```

Scaffold AI context files with optional orchestrator hints:

```bash
booklib init                         # .cursor/rules, CLAUDE.md, copilot-instructions, .gemini
booklib init --orchestrator=obra     # + superpowers install hint
booklib init --orchestrator=ruflo    # + ruflo install hint
```

## How Skills Activate

| Mechanism | What triggers it | Detail |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| **PreToolUse hook** | Editing a file matching a skill's `filePattern` | Injects only relevant chunks — fine-grained, automatic, silent |
| **Skill tool** | `Skill("effective-kotlin")` | Full skill dump on demand — used by orchestrators |
| **Search** | `booklib search "<concept>"` | Semantic vector search — returns the most relevant chunks |

The hook is the fine-grained layer. It fires on every `Read`/`Edit`/`Write`/`Bash` call, matches the file against skill patterns, and injects the relevant sections without you asking. The Skill tool is the coarse layer — a full knowledge dump, used by subagents that need a complete skill domain.

---

## Agents

| Agent | Model | Skills applied |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| `@booklib-reviewer` | sonnet | Auto-routes to the best skill |
| `@python-reviewer` | sonnet | effective-python · asyncio · web-scraping |
| `@ts-reviewer` | sonnet | effective-typescript · clean-code-reviewer |
| `@jvm-reviewer` | sonnet | effective-java · effective-kotlin · kotlin-in-action · spring-boot |
| `@rust-reviewer` | sonnet | programming-with-rust · rust-in-action |
| `@architecture-reviewer` | opus | domain-driven-design · microservices-patterns · system-design · data-intensive |
| `@data-reviewer` | sonnet | data-intensive-patterns · data-pipelines |
| `@ui-reviewer` | sonnet | refactoring-ui · storytelling-with-data · animation-at-work |

---

## Semantic Search & Audit

```bash
booklib search "how to handle null values in Kotlin"
booklib search "event sourcing vs CQRS" --role=architect
booklib audit effective-kotlin src/PaymentService.kt
booklib scan    # wisdom heatmap across the whole project
```

---

## Session Handoff

Preserves full context when switching agents or hitting rate limits:

```bash
booklib save-state --goal="..." --next="..." --progress="..."
booklib resume
booklib recover-auto    # auto-recover from last session or git history
```

Multi-agent coordination:

```bash
booklib sessions-list
booklib sessions-merge auth-session,payment-session combined
booklib sessions-lineage main feature-x "branched for auth work"
booklib sessions-compare python-audit,kotlin-audit src/auth.ts comparison
```

All session data lives in `.booklib/` (gitignored). Nothing sent to any server.

---

## MCP Server

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add booklib -- node /path/to/bin/booklib-mcp.js

# Cursor / Windsurf
{ "mcpServers": { "booklib": { "command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/bin/booklib-mcp.js"] } } }
```

MCP tools: `search_skills` · `audit_content` · `save_session_state` · `scan_project`

## Trust & Transparency

- **Book-grounded** — every bundled skill extracts practices from a canonical programming book
- **Evaluated** — quantitative evals: pass rate, delta over no-skill baseline
- **Open discovery** — community registry and source config are public and auditable
- **Local-first** — indexing, search, and session data stays on your machine
- **Marker-based ownership** — `.booklib` marker tracks which `~/.claude/skills/` dirs BookLib manages; never overwrites yours
- **Four runtime deps** — `@xenova/transformers`, `vectra`, `gray-matter`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
